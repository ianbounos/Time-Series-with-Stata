# Times series with Stata

Here we present the results of three intensive weeks of time series work at the IPSA Summer School 2024 at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

## First week

The fundamental concepts of time series are applied, such as Dickey Fuller stationarity tests, ARIMA models, and Box Jenkins methodology. Applications to historical univariate time series of inflation in Argentina (2017-2023) are presented, explaining it through an oversimplified model based on other variables such as the official exchange rate, parallel exchange rate, and monetary base.
